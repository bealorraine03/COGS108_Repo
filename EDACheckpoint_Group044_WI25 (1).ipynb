    "Our project’s purpose is to evaluate which lane on a high way is the safest to drive in. We want to specifically look at high ways in urban areas since these areas have the most traffic and busier highways.\n",

    "A study used a machine learning-based approach to predict the short-term impacts of lane changing maneuvers on traffic oscillations <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). They found that during traffic with the fastest speed and largest acceleration/deceleration rate in tight traffic, motorcycles were dangerously maneuvering by lane changing in smaller gaps and with larger speed differences. They also found that traffic flow was another factor in collisions during lane change, while truck lane changing showed restricted traffic flow. With this in mind, lanes that require less lane changing would be the most optimal for safety.\n", 
    "As referenced in the California Driver’s Handbook, the far left lane is known to be the ‘fast’ lane, or the passing lane, utilized for passing over other vehicles <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This is made in efforts to control traffic, considering that most right lanes are closely associated with nearby freeway exits and freeway entrances. With a majority of cars merging out of the middle lane to navigate towards their exit or entrance, this creates a build-up of traffic in the middle and right lanes. Especially during peak hours of the weekdays when most people are getting off work to drive home, there are factors that influence the decisions of drivers like feelings of impatience or ‘road rage’ in driving through traffic from the congestion of the middle and right lanes, that can ultimately lead to the possibility of accidents. \n",
